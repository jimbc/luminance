# Luminance
This script computes the stability and uniformity of luminance data measured according to B.C. Jim and A. Gebhard's transfer film luminance analysis as described [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.triboint.2020.106626).

For a working environment, the repository needs additional modules which can be found in a different repository [here](https://github.com/jimbc/jbc_tools).

For demonstration, an example file can be downloaded from [here](https://seafile.rlp.net/f/319e072dabe34173aa88/?dl=1).
